Author : Alban PERRIER

## Problematic
Using flock algorithm for car steering with variable colors, speeds, sizes.

## Context
Project : AI for video games : ENSC (AI) - Bordeaux INP 2022

## Launch
run `pip install -r requirements.txt`
run `python main.py`

# Work done
*screen*

- Creates vehicules that has different size using the mousewheel
- The vehicules has random force and speed when generated
- The vehicules has hp that decreases each time they got into a collision with an other vehicule
- The circuit is moving randomly and is bigger
